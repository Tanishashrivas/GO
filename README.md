### üìÇ Directory Structure  
The repository is organized into different Go files and folders:

- **`concurrency/`** - Covers Goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns.  
- **`file-handling/`** - Demonstrates reading/writing files and handling I/O.  
- **`web/`** - Contains examples related to building web servers and APIs in Go.  
- **`basics.go`** - Fundamental Go syntax, variables, loops, and data types.  
- **`closure.go`** - Understanding closures and function scopes in Go.  
- **`functions.go` / `functions2.go`** - Various function-related examples.  
- **`types.go`** - Covers Go‚Äôs type system and custom types.  
- **`user-input.go`** - Handling user input from the console.  

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code  
To execute any file, use the following command:  
```sh
go run filename.go
```
For example:  
```sh
go run basics.go
```

### üìå Prerequisites  
- Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your system.  
- Clone the repository:  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/tanishashrivas/<repo-name>.git
  cd <repo-name>
  ```

### ‚ö° Additional Notes
